# SkateApp
In Seattle we have a large skate community from roller derby to aggressive inline to trail cruisers to slalom enthusiesits and we all use a different app to set up our events. Shouldn't there be one place where we can post events, find new spots, link up with other skaters?

I had the idea originally when on our facebook page someone had posted a picture of a location that they found that would be great for skating. But as we all know once you post something on facebook if you give it 5 minutes it will be gone forever in the feed. Woudlnt it be nice to be able to post this picture on a map based system that pinned each location that way you could search your local area for different spots? At this point I took matters into my own hands..
